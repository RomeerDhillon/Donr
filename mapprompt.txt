# Create Map Feature for Donr App  
You are an expert React Native + Firebase + Google Maps developer.  
Please implement a full **Map feature** for the Donr app with the following requirements.

---

## 🧩 Requirements

### 1. Role-Specific Views
- **Donator**: sees nearby food banks & pantries, can donate food at a selected location  
- **Food Seeker**: sees nearby distribution centers, can request help  
- **Food Bank / Distributor**: sees incoming donation posts from donors, can accept or reject requests  

---

### 2. Data Sources (Firestore)
#### Food Centers
- Collection: `centers`
- Fields: `name`, `address`, `lat`, `lng`, `hours`, `centerType`, `phone`, `capacity`, `createdAt`

#### Donations
- Collection: `donations`
- Fields: `donorId`, `donorName`, `foodType`, `quantity`, `address`, `lat`, `lng`, `status`, `createdAt`

#### Food Requests
- Collection: `requests`
- Fields: `userId`, `foodType`, `urgency`, `lat`, `lng`, `createdAt`

---

### 3. Map Implementation
- Use **Google Maps SDK** (React Native)  
- Show **user location**  
- Show **markers** for:
  - Centers (blue/green)  
  - Donation posts (red)  
  - Food requests (orange)  
- Tapping a marker opens a **bottom sheet** with details and actions:  
  - Donator → Donate Here  
  - Food Seeker → Request Food / Get Directions  
  - Food Bank → Accept / Reject Donations  

---

### 4. Firestore Realtime
- Use `onSnapshot` to fetch collections in **realtime**  
- Markers update automatically when Firestore data changes  
- Only show markers relevant to the user’s role  

---

### 5. Directions / Navigation
- Include a button in the bottom sheet: **“Get Directions”**  
- Open Google Maps with coordinates:  
```ts
Linking.openURL(`https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=${lat},${lng}`);
6. Filters

Allow filtering by:

Open now

Nearby (within X km)

Center type (food bank, pantry, shelter)

Filters must respect the role:

Donator → only food centers

Seeker → only distribution centers

Distributor → only donations / requests

7. UI / UX

Full-screen map

Sticky header/navigation optional

Bottom sheet or modal for marker info

Responsive design for mobile devices

Marker clustering for performance if many locations

8. Security / Rules

Donators → read centers, write donations

Seekers → read centers, write requests

Distributors → read donations, update status

Admin → full access

Use Firestore rules to enforce access

9. Files to Create / Modify

MapScreen.tsx → main screen

/components/MapMarkerBottomSheet.tsx → bottom sheet for marker info

Firebase functions / hooks as needed for Firestore queries

Update navigation to include the map screen

10. Acceptance Criteria

Map shows correct markers for each role

Marker info displays relevant details in bottom sheet

Realtime Firestore updates are reflected immediately

Directions button opens Google Maps

Filters work correctly

UI is clean, functional, and mobile-responsive

Firestore security rules are applied
